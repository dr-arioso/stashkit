*StashKit* is a Python framework for building domain-aware interpreters that transform incomplete, ambiguous, or messy inputs into clean, structured entities.

It does this using:
⦁	*Dexes* — lightweight, portable domain ontologies (JSON)
⦁	*LexiDex* — a thin access layer over Dex data
⦁	*Resolvers* — orchestrators that iteratively interpret signals
⦁	*Skills* — atomic extraction and normalization steps
⦁	*BoosterPacks* — plug-in bundles that ship Dexes + resolvers + skills

StashKit makes it easy to build:
⦁	Product and entity classifiers
⦁	AI-assisted data ingestion pipelines
⦁	LLM-guided reasoning tools
⦁	Custom domain knowledge interpreters

StashKit also includes a *Dex Compiler* that produces safe, LLM-optimized projections (“MetaDex”), enabling models to reason effectively without hallucinating structure or inventing APIs.

Whether you're interpreting barcodes, architectural descriptions, cocktails, code, or end-user inputs, StashKit gives you the tools to make sense of the world — one Dex at a time.
