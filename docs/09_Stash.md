# Stash

The **Stash** is an optional persistence mechanism for resolved entities.

It is aware of:

- which Dex a given entity was interpreted under
- which resolver produced it
- versioning so entities can be re-evaluated under newer Dexes

Stash is intentionally simple and pluggable:

- store entities in a database
- or a document store
- or flat files – whatever fits your needs
